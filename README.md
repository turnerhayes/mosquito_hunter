# Mosquito Hunter

This web app provides a platform for education about malaria and the effects of climate change on the prevalence of the disease. It also allows users to help provide local surveillance of malaria risk by mapping locations of potential mosquito breeding grounds.

It also has instructions on building a simple mosquito trap at home, and allows users to mark placed traps on the map.


## Structure

The app is a Next.js app with a Redux store. The map view uses React Leaflet. On the backend, it uses React Server Components and a PostgresSQL database.
